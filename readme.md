### Smooth Fluids

This is a Factorio mod that smoothes out fluid-using recipes, making them
proportionally take less time, use less resources, and create less products.

It was born from the frustration of seeing refineries taking a long time to
process large batches of resources, and create weird-ass production graphs that
were absolutely useless in the short timeframe.

I think ideally they should process tiny amounts of fluids with every update,
but that most likely would require reworking how the game crafts items, so until
then this mod is the next best thing.
