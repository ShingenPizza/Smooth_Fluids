[mod-setting-description]
Smooth_Fluids-shortest-time-allowed=The lower this setting, the smoother the graphs will be. However, if the crafting time will get below the time between game updates (counting speed modules), it will cause issues. In vanilla 0.18s is the lowest number (at 0.01s precision) that should still work properly even with fully sped up refineries.
Smooth_Fluids-blacklist=In case you had issues with some recipes not smoothing out properly. Separate them with a comma, e.g. 'coal-liquefaction,light-oil-cracking'.
Smooth_Fluids-process-all-recipes=Should the mod process also recipes that do not involve fluids?
Smooth_Fluids-debug=Should the mod log what it does?
