[mod-setting-description]
Smooth_Fluids-shortest-time-allowed=The lower this setting, the smoother the graphs will be. However, if the crafting time will get below the time between game updates (counting speed modules), it will cause issues. In vanilla 0.2s is the lowest round number that should still work properly even with fully sped up refineries at 60 UPS.
Smooth_Fluids-debug=Should the mod log what it does?
